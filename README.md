## About
The Maturity Framework For the Detection Engineeing Discipline is both experiemental and subjective as its not something commonly implemented or standardized. With that in mind, some great engineers started this endeavor in which I am expanding on what worked for me, and providing information on what may benefit your program. 

#### Foundations of the Framework 
These are the foundations of the framework which I want to include, because it provided a standard or blue print. Both of these works are excpetional engineering and strategic thinking for the detection discipline.

### Maturity Levels 
#### M1: Maturity Level 1: Ad-Hoc
Maturity Level 1 is consider to be ad-hoc meaning, the engineering effort, procedures, strategy, or technology is not heavily structured. This can be impactful to efficiency, resources, and capabilities which can introduce limitations and barriers.

#### M2: Maturity Level 2: Organized
Maturity Level 2 revolves around more proactive actions, defined procedures, organization, improved strategy, and technology. This is an area where engineering is engaged regularly with familiarity, and even some developments that are working towards greater improvements. Here some limitations may exist, but the program is overall operational in various areas.

#### M3: Maturity Level 3: Optimized
Maturity Level 3 is the top maturity that can be achieved which is considered fully optimized solutions. When optimization is achieved strategy is well-defined, automation is increased (or even end-to-end), solutions are utilized to their full extent, and the program as a whole is fully engaged and proactive whether its a process or technology involved.


#### Repo Content
The repository content is spread sheet of the maturity matrix so that its easily understood and organized. There is also a dump of the framework in csv format for portability.
